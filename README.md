# Topic 1 :- JavaScript Variables

# What is a variable?

- A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a
  string that we might use as part of a sentence.
- Variables are Containers for Storing Data.
- JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
  - **Automatically** : It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables
    before use. ( Not Recommend )
  - **var** : Prefer not to use var because of issue block scope and functional scope.
  - **let** : Only use let if you can't use const and also for change the data.
  - **const** : Always use const if the value should not be changed and use const if the type
    should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
