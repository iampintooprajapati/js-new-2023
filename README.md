# Topic 1 :- JavaScript Variables

# What is a variable?

- A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a
  string that we might use as part of a sentence.
- Variables are Containers for Storing Data.
- JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
  - **Automatically** : It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables
    before use. ( Not Recommend )
  - **var** : Prefer not to use var because of issue block scope and functional scope.
  - **let** : Only use let if you can't use const and also for change the data.
  - **const** : Always use const if the value should not be changed and use const if the type
    should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

# Topic 2 :- JavaScript Array

# What is an Array?

- The **Array** object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables
  **storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name**, and has members
  for **performing common array operations**.
- Array objects with the following core characteristics:
  - JavaScript arrays are **resizable and can contain a mix of different** data types.
  - JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays.
  - JavaScript arrays are **zero-indexed**: the first element of an array is at index 0.
  - JavaScript **array-copy operations** create **shallow copies**.

# Topic 3 :- JavaScript Promise

# What is an Promise?

- The **Promise** object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and 
  its resulting value.
- A **Promise** is in one of these states::
  - **pending**: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected..
  - **fulfilled**: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
  - **rejected**: meaning that the operation failed..
